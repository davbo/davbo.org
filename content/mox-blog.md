Title: Mobile Oxford team blog
Date: 19/5/2013
Summary: I wrote some words on another website and you should maybe read them.

Recently we launched a [Mobile Oxford blog](http://blog.m.ox.ac.uk) and I just wanted to leave links here to a couple of posts on there. Firstly my own post, of course. [Thoughts on building JavaScript clients](http://blog.m.ox.ac.uk/posts/2013/04/24/js-client-thoughts/) and secondly a brilliant blog post by my colleague [Martin Filliau](http://martin.filliau.com/) on [building web services for the new Mobile Oxford](http://blog.m.ox.ac.uk/posts/2013/04/18/mobile-oxford-services/) this talks about what we're doing with Moxie a topic I've mentioned here before.

We also recently attended Whisky Web II, a conference in Edinburgh and wrote [some words about that](http://blog.m.ox.ac.uk/posts/2013/04/25/whisky-web-conference/).

Ciao, Dave.
