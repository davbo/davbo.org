Title: OpenTech 2013
Date: 20/5/2013
Summary: Brief writeup from the recent OpenTech conference
Status: draft

After recently attending the brilliant [OpenTech](http://www.opentech.org.uk/2013/) conference in London my brain is full of fresh, occasionally terrifying, knowledge.

Firstly I have to recommend everyone to go read Bill Thomson's excellent ["State of the Intersection"](http://www.thebillblog.com/2013/05/the-state-of-the-intersection-my-opentech-talk/). While I think there's plenty of over-exaggerations which were raised during the brief Q&A afterwards I do largely agree with his sentiment. Particularly his insightful reflection on the Luddites which seems very pertinent to me.
